# ADDENDA 12: Install ArgoCD in this lab
#########################################################################################

ArgoCD is a Continuous Delivery tool that is becoming more & more popular.  
In a nutshell, you can use it in a GitOps fashion. It will monitor your code repository & apply changes to the infrastructure when a new commit/push has been performed.  

Trident 21.04 introduced backend management through yaml files & Kubernetes CRD.  
Its lifecycle can then be totally integrated into ArgoCD.

I will describe here how to install ArgoCD (super easy) & how to access it.  
I consider that a Load Balancer, such as MetalLB, will assign an IP address to the ArgoCD service upon creation.  
Refer to [Addenda05](../Addenda05) to intall MetalLB.  

If you have not yet read the [Addenda08](../Addenda08) about the Docker Hub management, it would be a good time to do so.  
Also, if no action has been made with regards to the container images, you can find a shell script in this directory _scenario10_pull_images.sh_ to pull images utilized in this scenario if needed. It uses 2 parameters, your Docker Hub login & password:

```bash
sh addenda12_pull_images.sh my_login my_password
```

You can now proceed with the installation of MetalLB, granted the manifests need to be updated in order to reflect the use of a private repository.

The first part described how to install ArgoCD in its own namespace, as well as updating its service, granted the manifests need to be updated in order to reflect the use of a private repository.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.4.3/manifests/install.yaml
sed -i s,quay.io,registry.demo.netapp.com, install.yaml
sed -i s,ghcr.io,registry.demo.netapp.com, install.yaml
sed -i s,redis:7,registry.demo.netapp.com\/redis:7, install.yaml

kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f install.yaml
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

Now, let's retrive its IP address, automatically assigned by MetalLB

```bash
kubectl get svc -n argocd argocd-server | awk '{ print $4 }'
EXTERNAL-IP
192.168.0.140
```

Last, you need to retrieve the password for the admin account.  
The initial password is auto-generated and stored as clear text in the field password in a secret named argocd-initial-admin-secret

```bash
$ kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
nnrSlpSsgWSQscJn
```

& voil√†, ArgoCD is installed & ready to be used !
